## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES

### Phase 1: Backend Setup ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Clinic Model Update
```typescript
// File: src/models/Clinic.ts
export const RETAINED_CLINICS_CONFIG = {
  'bodyblissphysio': { ... },
  'BodyBlissOneCare': { ... },
  'Century Care': { ... },
  'Ortholine Duncan Mills': { ... },
  'My Cloud': { ... },

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### Test Scenario 1: Authentication Flow
```
1. POST /auth/login
   → Request: { email, password }
   ← Response: { accessToken, refreshToken }
   
2. GET /clients/clinic/bodyblissphysio (with token)
   → Authorization: Bearer ${token}
   ← Response: Paginated clients for clinic
   
3. GET /clients/clinic/bodyblissphysio (without token)
   ← Response: 401 Unauthorized
```

### Test Scenario 2: Client Management Workflow
```
1. POST /clients
   → Create client with 3-tier insurance
   ← Response: Client created with ID
   
2. GET /clients/:id/frontend-compatible
   ← Response: Client WITHOUT work phone, family MD, CSR
   ← Insurance: 2-tier display (1st + 2nd only)
   
3. PUT /clients/:id
   → Update client data
   ← Response: Updated client, cache invalidated
   
4. GET /clients/clinic/:clinic/frontend-compatible
   ← Response: All clinic clients, transformed
```

### Test Scenario 3: Appointment to Order to Payment
```
1. POST /appointments
   → Create appointment with resourceId + duration
   ← Response: Appointment confirmed
   
2. PUT /appointments/:id/complete
   → Mark ready for billing
   ← Response: Appointment status = completed, readyToBill = true
   
3. GET /appointments/billing/ready
   ← Response: [appointment ready for billing]
   
4. POST /orders
   → Create order from appointment
   ← Response: Order created with lineItems
   
5. POST /orders/:id/payment
   → Process payment
   ← Response: Payment recorded, order status updated
```

### Test Scenario 4: Clinic Filtering
```
1. GET /clinics/frontend-compatible
   ← Response: 
   {
     "clinics": [
       { "name": "bodyblissphysio", "displayName": "BodyBliss Physiotherapy" },
       { "name": "BodyBlissOneCare", "displayName": "BodyBliss OneCare" },
       { "name": "Century Care", ... },
       { "name": "Ortholine Duncan Mills", ... },
       { "name": "My Cloud", ... },
       { "name": "Physio Bliss", ... }
     ],
     "total": 6,
     "retainedOnly": true
   }
   
2. GET /clients/clinic/InvalidClinic/frontend-compatible
   ← Response: 400 Bad Request - Clinic not in retained list
```

### Test Scenario 5: Insurance Transformation
```
1. POST /clients
   → Create with 3 insurance plans
   {
     "insurance": [
       { "type": "1st", "company": "Insurance Co 1" },
       { "type": "2nd", "company": "Insurance Co 2" },
       { "type": "3rd", "company": "Insurance Co 3" }
     ]
   }

2. GET /clients/:id/frontend-compatible
   ← Response: 
   {
     "insurance": [
       { "type": "1st", "company": "Insurance Co 1" },
       { "type": "2nd", "company": "Insurance Co 2" }
     ]
   }
   ← Note: 3rd insurance excluded from frontend response
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Frontend receives 401 Unauthorized
**Solution**: Verify JWT token is sent in Authorization header with "Bearer " prefix

**Issue**: Clinic not found in dropdown
**Solution**: Verify clinic name matches retained clinic list (6 clinics only)

**Issue**: Client shows deprecated fields
**Solution**: Use `/clients/:id/frontend-compatible` endpoint instead of regular `/clients/:id`

**Issue**: Insurance shows 3 plans instead of 2
**Solution**: Frontend should use `transformInsuranceForFrontend()` on client data
