**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Comparison:** Original BodyBliss Visio vs New Modern Application  
**Tested By:** AI Analysis using Playwright MCP

## Quick Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well
1. **Modern UI/UX** - Significantly improved visual design and user experience
2. **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. **Real-time Statistics** - Dashboard displays key metrics effectively
4. **Architecture** - Clean API-driven architecture with better maintainability
5. **Security** - Modern authentication and authorization patterns
6. **Performance** - Faster page loads and smoother interactions

### ‚ùå Critical Missing Features
1. **Calendar/Schedule View** - No time-grid appointment scheduler (DEALBREAKER)
2. **Insurance Form Generation** - Missing insurance claim form templates
3. **Resource Scheduling** - No resource (therapist/room) management
4. **Lab Module** - Entire lab tracking section missing
5. **Invoice System** - No invoice generation or advanced billing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Missing Features
- Work phone fields in client management
- CSR Name assignment
- Multi-location selection for clients
- Separate city/province/postal code fields
- Print functionality (schedules, reports)
- TO DO LIST / Task management
- Marketing/Relations module

---

## Deployment Readiness: **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

### Why Not Ready:
The **appointment scheduling calendar** is the core functionality of a physiotherapy clinic management system. The original application has a sophisticated DayPilot scheduler with:
- Day/Week/Month/Timeline views
- Resource-based scheduling
- Visual time slots
- Drag-and-drop appointments
- Multiple resource management

The new application only shows a list view with authentication errors. This is a critical gap that prevents deployment.
